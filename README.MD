# Why

This project was made in order to learn more about the javascript use in html and how to use the properties of the DOM.

# Things learned

I was able to learn about how use the DOM properties in order to construct a HTML element with the provided information of a API (github api).

- I found out that with the template string we can declared a div and pass it to a variable
- With the `innerHTML` property of a element of the DOM we can alter his HTML features
- Using `document.getElementById("element name")` we can retrieve a element of the DOM
- We can use `document.createElement("element tag")` in order to create un element with the specified tag. We can also use `document.appendChild(elementCreated)` in order to add that element created to another element of the DOM
- Using the property `classList` we can retrieve the list of classes of a particular element of the DOM. We can also use the function `add("name")` to add another class to the specified element.
- We can use the properties with the `.` notation in order to read or give a value to the attributes of the element

# Overall

Learned how to do a API call on the javascript file. Learned how to use string interpolation to create a div to use in the DOM. Learned how to create a element in the using the DOM functions and assigned it to a element already in the DOM. Learned how to use the classList property to attribute a name for the CSS Selector identify it.

# Considerations

In the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript it's been amazing how the three are put up together to give so much options to make awesome designs and incredible web apps with a kind of a simple way of coding.
